* Problem: Minimum-Turn Cycle Cover in Planar Grid Graphs
* Statement:
What is the complexity of finding a cycle-cover of a planar grid graph
that has the fewest possible $90^\circ$ turns?
(An $180^\circ$ U-turn counts as two turns.)
A \emph{planar grid graph} is a graph whose vertices are any set
of points on the planar integer lattice and whose edges connect every
pair of vertices at unit distance.
* Origin: Aggarwal et al.~\cite{ackms-amtsp-97} show that the
more general problem of finding a cycle cover for a planar
set of points that minimizes total turn angle is NP-hard.
Arkin et al.~\cite{abdfms-octtc-01,abdfms-octtc-05} consider the problem
in grid graphs, but are only able to give approximations.
* Status/Conjectures: Solved: proved NP-hard by Fekete and Krupke~\cite{fk-ctcctc-19}
* Motivation: Minimizing turns is a natural geometric measure;
understanding its algorithmic behavior is of general interest.
* Partial and Related Results:
\cite{abdfms-octtc-01,abdfms-octtc-05} show that the problem is polynomially solvable
when restricted to \emph{thin} grid graphs, i.e., grid graphs that do not
contain an induced $2 \times 2$ square.
For this special case, the problem behaves somewhat similarly to a
Chinese Postman Problem.
The problem of finding a minimum-turn tour is shown to be NP-complete,
even for this special case.

In 2019, Fekete and Krupke~\cite{fk-ctcctc-19} established that
finding a minimum-turn cycle cover in a planar grid graph is NP-hard,
thereby providing an answer to this problem.
